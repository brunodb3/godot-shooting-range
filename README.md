# [GDLearn #4] Shooting Range

This is the fourth entry on my personal challenge, the GDLearn. My goal is to upload at least one game to http://itch.io every month, on an attempt to learn about video game development using the Godot Engine.

Shooting Range is my first attempt on making a 3D game with Godot. The idea is for it to be a simple third person shooter with a couple core mechanics.

Be aware this is a prototype made for learning purposes only.
